AddthisHelper v.1.0
=============

The Addthis Helper is a plugin to make the integration of the Addthis social bookmarking tool 
(www.addthis.com) easy in a rails project.

All this plugin provides are 2 helper methods for the addthis tool.  There are no public files.

The first method provided is for the default addthis widget to open the addthis popup.

The second is for the addthis customizeable widget.



Example
=======

Both methods take 4  parameters.  The first two are madatory and the second two are optional.
The first param is your addthis username (the addthis_pub variable)
The second param is the source for the image
The third param is an optional set of image attributes (alt tag, border, etc...)
The fourth param is an optional set of addthis variables.

To use the STANDARD addthis widget call the following in your view:

<%= add_this('username', 'http://s9.addthis.com/button0-share.gif') %>

The add_this method take 4 parameters.  The first two are madatory and the second two are optional.
The first param is your addthis_pub username
The second param is the source for the image

To use the optional params see the following:

<%= add_this('username', 'http://s9.addthis.com/button0-share.gif', {:width => 83, :height => 16, :border => 0, :alt => 'Bookmark and Share' }, {:addthis_title => 'Page Title', :addthis_url => 'http://www.sitename.com/'}) %>

In the standard method only 2 variables apply.

addthis_url and addthis_title

addthis_url is the URL you want to pass to the widget for the bookmark.  
By default (not passed in) this is: location.href
Generally you should leave this out unless you want to put in a specific URL to track the page views that come back from a social bookmarking site.

addthis_title is the Title you want to pass to the widget for the bookmark.
By default (not passed in) this is: document.title
Generally this should not be passed in either unless you want to change the title of the page in the bookmarking tool.

So in general with the standard widget the 4 param (addthis variables) can be completely left out.


To use the CUSTOMIZEABLE addthis widget call the following in your view:

<%= add_this_custom('username', 'http://s9.addthis.com/button0-share.gif', {:width => 83, :height => 16, :border => 0, :alt => 'Bookmark and Share' }, {:addthis_title => 'Page Title'}) %>

The four params are the same as the standard widget except the fourth param in the customizeable widget accepts more values.
In addition to addthis_title and addthis_url see the following page for the complete list of addthis variables.
http://www.addthis.com/customization.php

Name the keys in the options hash the same name as the variable.
(All the plugin does is convert the key to a string and pass it as the variable name along with the value).
All values should be passed in as strings except for addthis_offset_top and addthis_offset_left which are integers.
